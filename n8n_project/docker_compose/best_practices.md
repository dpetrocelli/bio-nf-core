# Docker Compose Improvements for Ollama with GPU

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- Split the service initialization from the main service using a separate `ollama-init` container.
- The main `ollama` service now focuses solely on serving, while `ollama-init` handles model downloading.
- This follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** — each container has one clear job.

### 2. Health Checks

- Added a proper health check to ensure the Ollama service is ready before dependent services start.
- Uses the `/api/health` endpoint to verify service availability.
- Configured with reasonable timeouts and retry intervals:
  - **interval:** `30s` — Check every 30 seconds
  - **timeout:** `10s` — Wait up to 10 seconds for response
  - **retries:** `3` — Try 3 times before marking as unhealthy
  - **start_period:** `30s` — Give the service 30 seconds to start before beginning health checks

### 3. Service Dependencies

- Used `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` to ensure proper startup order.
- The `init` service only runs after the main service is confirmed healthy.
- This prevents race conditions and ensures reliable initialization.

### 4. Restart Policies

- Main service uses `unless-stopped` — appropriate for long-running services.
- Init service uses `"no"` restart policy since it's a one-time operation.
- This prevents the `init` container from repeatedly trying to download models.

### 5. Networking

- Added explicit network configuration for better service isolation and communication.
- Services communicate through the named network rather than default bridge.
- Provides better control over container networking and security.

### 6. Volume Configuration

- Explicitly specified `driver: local` for the volume.
- While this is the default, being explicit improves readability and maintainability.

### 7. Security & Reliability

- Removed the complex shell command that combined multiple operations.
- Each container has a single, clear responsibility.
- Better error handling through health checks and proper dependencies.
- Eliminated potential issues with background processes and signal handling.

## Benefits of These Changes

### ✅ Reliability

- Proper startup sequencing ensures services start in the correct order.
- Health checks provide visibility into service status.
- Cleaner separation reduces complexity and potential failure points.

### ✅ Maintainability

- Clear service boundaries make it easier to understand what each component does.
- Explicit configuration reduces ambiguity.
- Standard patterns make it easier for other developers to understand.

### ✅ Operational Excellence

- Better logging and debugging with separated concerns.
- Easier to scale or modify individual components.
- More predictable behavior in production environments.
